GLaDOS Enhancer Plus
====================

Introduction
------------

**Hello folks!**

This script was a collaborative effort for making a better countdown aid which directly enhanced the official `GLaDOS@Home status page <http://www.aperturescience.com/glados@home/>`_ during the final challenge of the `Valve ARG <http://valvearg.com>`_.

The project has been initiated by Aubron and p2k, both participators in the `Valve ARG IRC Channel <http://valvearg.com/wiki/IRC>`_. Due to its nature, this project was quite short-lived and is no longer of any use by itself since the end of the ARG.

See some screenshots while the project was active `over here <https://github.com/p2k/GLaDOS-Enhancer-Plus/wiki/Last-Screenshot>`_ and `here https://github.com/p2k/GLaDOS-Enhancer-Plus/wiki/Older-Screenshots>`_.

You can still `get the final version here <https://github.com/p2k/GLaDOS-Enhancer-Plus/raw/master/glados_enhancer_plus.user.js>`_, if you like.

**Big thanks go out to all contributors, supporters and users which gave me feedback and suggestions how to improve the script. I hope you all enjoyed using the script as much as I enjoyed coding it. Hope to see you all again.**
